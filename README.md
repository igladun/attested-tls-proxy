# `attested-tls-proxy`

This is a work-in-progress crate designed to be an alternative to [`cvm-reverse-proxy`](https://github.com/flashbots/cvm-reverse-proxy).
Unlike `cvm-reverse-proxy`, this uses post-handshake remote-attested TLS, meaning regular CA-signed TLS certificates can be used.

It has three subcommands:
- `attested-tls-proxy server` - run a proxy server, which accepts TLS connections from a proxy client, sends an attestation and then forwards traffic to a target CVM service.
- `attested-tls-proxy client` - run a proxy client, which accepts connections from elsewhere, connects to and verifies the attestation from the proxy server, and then forwards traffic to it over TLS.
- `attested-tls-proxy get-tls-cert` - connects to a proxy-server, verify the attestation, and if successful write the server's PEM-encoded TLS certificate chain to standard out. This can be used to make subsequent connections to services using this certificate over regular TLS.

### How it works

This is a reverse HTTP proxy allowing a normal HTTP client to communicate with a normal HTTP server over a remote-attested TLS channel, by tunneling requests through a proxy-client and proxy-server.

This works as follows:
1. The source HTTP client (eg: curl or a web browser) makes an HTTP request to a proxy-client instance running locally.
2. The proxy-client forwards the request to a proxy-server instance over a remote-attested TLS channel.
3. The proxy-server forwards the request to the target service over regular HTTP.
4. The response from the target service is sent back to the source client, via the proxy-server and proxy-client.

One or both of the proxy-client and proxy-server may be running in a confidential environment and provide attestations which will be verified by the remote party. Verification is configured by a measurements file, and attestation generation is configured by specifying an attestation type when starting the proxy client or server.

### Measurements File

Accepted measurements for the remote party are specified in a JSON file containing an array of objects, each of which specifies an accepted attestation type and set of measurements.

This aims to match the formatting used by `cvm-reverse-proxy`.

These object have the following fields:
- `measurement_id` - a name used to describe the entry. For example the name and version of the CVM OS image that these measurements correspond to.
- `attestation_type` - a string containing one of the attestation types (confidential computing platforms) described below. 
- `measurements` - an object with fields referring to the five measurement registers. Field names are the same as for the measurement headers (see below).

Example:

```JSON
[
    {
        "measurement_id": "dcap-tdx-example",
        "attestation_type": "dcap-tdx",
        "measurements": {
            "0": {
                "expected": "47a1cc074b914df8596bad0ed13d50d561ad1effc7f7cc530ab86da7ea49ffc03e57e7da829f8cba9c629c3970505323"
            },
            "1": {
                "expected": "da6e07866635cb34a9ffcdc26ec6622f289e625c42c39b320f29cdf1dc84390b4f89dd0b073be52ac38ca7b0a0f375bb"
            },
            "2": {
                "expected": "a7157e7c5f932e9babac9209d4527ec9ed837b8e335a931517677fa746db51ee56062e3324e266e3f39ec26a516f4f71"
            },
            "3": {
                "expected": "e63560e50830e22fbc9b06cdce8afe784bf111e4251256cf104050f1347cd4ad9f30da408475066575145da0b098a124"
            },
            "4": {
                "expected": "000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
            }
        }
    }
]
```

If a path to this file is not given or it contains an empty array, **any** attestation type and **any** measurements will be accepted, **including no attestation**. The measurements can still be checked up-stream by the source client or target service using header injection described below. But it is then up to these external programs to reject unacceptable configurations. 

### Measurement Headers

When attestation is validated successfully, the following headers are injected into the HTTP request / response making them available to the source client and/or target service.

These aim to match the header formatting used by `cvm-reverse-proxy`.

Header name: `X-Flashbots-Measurement`

Header value:
```json
{
  "0": "48 byte MRTD value encoded as hex",
  "1": "48 byte RTMR0 value encoded as hex",
  "2": "48 byte RTMR1 value encoded as hex",
  "3": "48 byte RTMR2 value encoded as hex",
  "4": "48 byte RTMR3 value encoded as hex",
}
```

Header name: `X-Flashbots-Attestation-Type`

Header value: an attestation type given as a string as described below.
  
## Attestation Types

These are the attestation type names used in the HTTP headers, and the measurements file, and when specifying a local attestation type with the `--client-attestation-type` or `--server-attestation-type` command line options.

- `none` - No attestation provided
- `dummy` - Forwards the attestation to a remote service (for testing purposes, not yet supported)
- `gcp-tdx` - DCAP TDX on Google Cloud Platform
- `azure-tdx` - TDX on Azure, with MAA (not yet supported)
- `qemu-tdx` - TDX on Qemu (no cloud platform)
- `dcap-tdx` - DCAP TDX (platform not specified)

## Protocol Specification

A proxy-client client will immediately attempt to connect to the given proxy-server.

Proxy-client to proxy-server connections use TLS 1.3.

The protocol name `flashbots-ratls/1` must be given in the TLS configuration for ALPN protocol negotiation during the TLS handshake. Future versions of this protocol will use incrementing version numbers, eg: `flashbots-ratls/2`.

### Attestation Exchange

Immediately after the TLS handshake, an attestation exchange is made. The server first provides an attestation message (even if it has the `none` attestation type). The client verifies, if verification is successful it also provides an attestation message and otherwise closes the connection. If the server cannot verify the client's attestation, it closes the connection.

Attestation exchange messages are formatted as follows:
- A 4 byte length prefix - a big endian encoded unsigned 32 bit integer
- A SCALE (Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian) encoded [struct](./src/attestation/mod.rs) with the following fields:
  - Attestation type - a string with one of the attestation types (described above) including `none`.
  - Attestation - the actual attestation data. In the case of DCAP this is a binary quote report. In the case of `none` this is an empty byte array.

SCALE is used by parity/substrate and was chosen because it is simple and actually matches the formatting used in TDX quotes. So it was already used as a dependency (of the `dcap-qvl` crate) here.

## Attestation Generation and Verification

Attestation input takes the form of a 64 byte array.

The first 32 bytes are the SHA256 hash of the encoded public key from the TLS leaf certificate of the party providing the attestation, DER encoded exactly as given in the certificate.

The remaining 32 bytes are exported key material ([RFC5705](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5705)) from the TLS session. This must have the exporter label `EXPORTER-Channel-Binding` and no context data.

In the case of attestation types `dcap-tx`, `gcp-tdx`, and `qemu-tdx`, a standard DCAP attestation is generated using the `configfs-tsm` linux filesystem interface. This means that this binary must be run with access to `/sys/kernel/config/tsm/report` which on many systems requires sudo. 

When verifying DCAP attestations, the Intel PCS is used to retrieve collateral unless a PCCS url is provided via a command line argument. If expired TCB collateral is provided, the quote will fail to verify.

## HTTP reverse proxy

Following a successful attestation exchange, the client can make HTTP requests using HTTP2, and the server will forward them to the target service.

As described above, the server will inject measurement data into the request headers before forwarding them to the target service, and the client will inject measurement data into the response headers before forwarding them to the source client.
